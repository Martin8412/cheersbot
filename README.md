A bot for XMPP with various basic fun commands

A basic modular bot written in Java for XMPP services.
The bot relies on the XMPP library Smack, http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/

The bot has been rewritten for a more modular structure

To use the bot one must copy the config.properties.dist file to config.properties, and change the values as needed
The bot takes an arbitrary number of channels seperated by commas.
